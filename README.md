One of the significant threats facing the Internet today is the vast amount of data and files that must be evaluated for potential malicious intent. Malicious software, commonly known as malware, is designed by attackers and can exhibit polymorphic and metamorphic characteristics, meaning it can change its code as it spreads. The diversity and high volume of malware variants severely undermine the effectiveness of traditional defenses, which typically rely on signature-based techniques that cannot detect previously unknown malicious executables.

Despite this challenge, variants of malware families often share typical behavioral patterns that reflect their origin and purpose. These behavioral patterns can be analyzed both statically and dynamically, allowing for the potential detection and classification of unknown malware into their known families using machine learning techniques. This survey paper provides an overview of the various techniques and tools available for detecting and analyzing malware.
